# SQE Frontend Deployment

The SQE Frontend is stored in a Google Cloud Platform bucket called sqe-website.

The bucket was created as explained in this tutorial: Hosting a static website  |  Cloud Storage  |  Google Cloud

## Production
The data is stored on a GCP bucket called sqe-website, with public read permissions.
Uploading a new version

To upload a new version of the frontend to the bucket, pull the ScrollEditor version you want, and run:

    yarn install
    yarn build

    gsutil -m rsync -R dist gs://sqe-website
    gcloud compute url-maps invalidate-cdn-cache sqe-website-lb --path "/*" (invalidate the cache so people get the update in their browser)

Once youâ€™re done, the new compiled frontend should be available.

## Staging
Data is stored in an S3 bucket called `sqe-staging`. Upload it from the AWS CLI, configured with the Research Software Company `webdeployer` user credentials:

    aws s3 sync . s3://sqe-staging
